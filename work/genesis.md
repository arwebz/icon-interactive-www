  text_block: "<h2>Background</h2><p>Merging the traditional game of golf with a vehicle
    launch can bring many different opportunities. ICON was tasked to not only provide
    a solution to this challenge but adapt it for future events including PGA Tour
    stop sponsorships.</p><h2>Goal</h2><p>The project’s main objectives were twofold:
    to build awareness of the Genesis brand, and to create relevancy for guests to
    physically get in and experience a Genesis G90 car. These objectives were later
    adapted to focus more on tracking attendance and gauging guests’ interest in the
    Genesis brand at various PGA Tour events.</p><h2>Solution</h2><p>Through data
    visualization, digital projection mapping, and mobile technology designed to work
    with TrackMan’s cutting-edge launch monitor technology, the team transformed a
    luxury sedan into an intimate theater; taking players on a personalized tour of
    both the Genesis brand and their own golf game.</p>"
