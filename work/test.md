    to be able to show. We want to make sure our fans have a great experience and
    leave saying ‘thank you for being here and thank you for creating this experience.’
    We got that. And they told us… this is the best fan day activation we have seen
    in Chevy Plaza in a long time."</p><p><strong>Matt Archambault, Head of NA Partnerships
