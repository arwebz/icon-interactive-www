  text_block: <h2>Challenge</h2><p>Dream up and execute an attention-grabbing tour
    that would raise awareness and interest in the I-Pace.</p><h2>Solution</h2><p>ICON
    proposed a series of Video and Photo spots that would be used both internally
    and externally to generate a buzz around the launch.</p><p>The first shoot was
    a vehicle convoy “flash mob” around San Francisco during the Global Climate Summit
    that drove by several key landmarks. This took place three months before the vehicle
    went on sale. We used this opportunity to capture hero images for their marketing
    plans, social media, and PR/communications.</p><p>This video had a call to action
    that drove people to sign up for the Jaguar Electrifies tour that started in San
    Francisco a few weeks later. The tour was a full experience that featured ride
    and drives, social sharable moments, and new technologies that were showcased
    by Wired Magazine.</p><p>The tour stopped in San Francisco, Miami, and Los Angeles.</p><p>The
    events were such a success, that Jaguar decided to create an abbreviated version
    of the tour experience at a number of major Auto Shows including LA, Chicago,
    and Washington DC.</p><p>In 2019, the I-Pace went on to win "World Car of the
    Year,” “World Green Car of the Year,” and "World Car Design of the Year”—a clean
    sweep from the World Car Awards (WCA).</p>
