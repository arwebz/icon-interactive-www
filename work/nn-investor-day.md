  text_block: "<h2>Challenge</h2><p>The event in 2018 marked the first time that it
    would be held at their new headquarters in Charlotte, NC which opened earlier
    that year. This state-of-the-art facility houses their Innovation Center which
    was introduced at Investor Day. We were called in to create a series of video
    vignettes for their various end markets, as well as an animated piece for their
    large 12 screen LED wall.</p><h2>Solution</h2><p>With a fairly short timeline
    of only a few weeks, our design team got together and built a series of custom
    3D animations and wove it together with the companyâ€™s updated branding and existing
    video footage. We launched this piece on the livestream to kick off the Investor
    Day event and then looped it on the LED wall in the Innovation Center. This piece
    is currently used as an overview video for the company and its capabilities when
    customers visit the Charlotte offices. It will also be used on the new NN, Inc.
    website which we are launching in early 2020.</p>"
