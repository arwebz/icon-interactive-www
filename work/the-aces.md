  intro_paragraph: "<p>We built and designed a completely custom site to both highlight
    The Aces new look and photos and provide a place for the listening party voting
    to take place. Our custom interface allowed votes to be counted both from the
    top cities streaming the single as well as the top cities voted for on the site
    itself. This also enabled us to collect contact and location data for fans of
    the band, so that they could later be notified for shows in their area and retargeted
    upon the album’s release to purchase.</p>"

  text_block: "<h2>Background</h2><p>Red Bull Records, the music branch of the global
    energy drink brand, came to ICON with a challenge. One of their bands, The Aces,
    had a new record coming out, and wanted to connect with their fans in a new way
    - through listening parties.</p><h2>Goal</h2><p>Fans would join with the band
    to listen to the new record together, as the band travels the country. To best
    determine where to hold these parties, they wanted to run a contest where fans
    could vote for which cities the listening parties should be hosted in.</p><h2>Solution</h2><p>ICON
    would build a website where fans could vote for their city by streaming The Aces
    new single, “Daydream”, or by registering their information once per day on the
    site. This would verify each vote as being associated with a real person by capturing
    their name and location.</p>"
