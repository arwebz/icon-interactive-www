  text_block: <h2>Background</h2><p>Red Bull Records, the music branch of the global
    energy drink brand, came to ICON with a challenge. One of their bands, The Aces,
    had a new record coming out, and wanted to connect with their fans in a new way
    - through listening parties.</p><h2>Goal</h2><p>Fans would join with the band
    to listen to the new record together, as the band travels the country. To best
    determine where to hold these parties, they wanted to run a contest where fans
    could vote for which cities the listening parties should be hosted in.</p><h2>Solution</h2><p>ICON
    would build a website where fans could vote for their city by streaming The Aces
    new single, “Daydream”, or by registering their information once per day on the
    site. This would verify each vote as being associated with a real person by capturing
    their name and location.</p><h2>Deliverables</h2><p>We built and designed a completely
    custom site at <a href="https://theacesofficial.com" title="https://theacesofficial.com">https://theacesofficial.com</a>
    to both highlight The Aces new look and photos, and to provide a place for the
    listening party voting to take place. Our custom interface allowed votes to be
    counted both from the top cities streaming the single, as well as the top cities
    voted for on the site itself. We were able to verify that real people were voting,
    as well as limit fans to one vote per day by verifying their vote through a unique
    code sent to either their phone number or email address. This also enabled us
    to collect contact and location data for fans of the band so they could later
    be notified of upcoming shows in their area, and it allowed us to retarget them
    upon the album’s release for purchase. To display results, we implemented a live
    leaderboard on the website showcasing the top cities in both categories.</p>

    left_column: '<h2>Technical Approach</h2><p>There were 3 primary technical challenges
      for this website that we encountered: voting, streaming rankings, and performant
      animations.</p><p class="p1">For voting, we needed to create a system that allowed
      for an individual to vote once per day, but also allow multiple different ways
      to vote. We built this system from the ground up, and integrated directly with
      social media to allow the additional voting. This provided Redbull Records with
      a lot of insight into where their engaged audience was, but also how they interact
      with the band.</p>'
    right_column: <p>In addition to displaying cities by their vote totals, we also
      wanted to rank cities by the amount of daily streams. Unfortunately we could
      not obtain data at the granular level that we were looking for directly from
      streaming platforms, however working with an analytics company, daily reports
      of streaming numbers could be pulled into the site and updated.</p><p class="p1">With
      a minimalist design to the website, small animations throughout were needed
      to keep users interested and engaged. We also needed these animations to not
      hinder performance or load times in any way. Using the anime.js library to create
      scripted timeline-based animations and the interaction observer API we could
      control the movement of the site, while keeping everything smooth and fast.</p>

  text_block: "<h2>Results</h2><p>The results speak for themselves. Over 7,300 people
    voted on the site for the band to visit their city, capturing exactly 7,322 phone
    numbers and emails tied to location data. Each fan voted twice on average, for
    a total of over 14,000 votes. Fans voted from 140 different cities around the
    country.</p><p>Engagement for the site skyrocketed over the course of the contest,
    increasing over 200%, with the average visitor returning to the site 3 times per
    day to vote and check the results. The contest was a success - The Aces will set
    out on their listening tour to meet their highly engaged fans, which were able
    to target down to the city. Additionally, Red Bull Records gained a rich data
    set and a deep understanding of their band’s customer base, which they will be
    able to use to build targeted campaigns in the future.</p>"
