brief_label: Building Brand Awareness
brief: "<p>The first iteration of the Genesis Performance Lab saw its launch at the
  Streamsong Resort, where Genesis hosted its Genesis Invitational. It was a high-profile
  event—the culmination of a series of smaller golf tournaments—so the client team
  sought a striking experience that would be capable of appealing to an upscale, golf-minded
  audience. The project’s main objectives were twofold: to build awareness of the
  Genesis brand, and to create relevancy for guests to physically get in and experience
  a Genesis G90 car.</p><p>The original Genesis Performance Lab was comprised of a
  user pathway designed to personalize the experience for each participant, treating
  them as VIPs at every touchpoint. First, guests teed off in a special practice area,
  where a TrackMan launch monitor analyzed the metrics of their swings. Then, escorted
  by a PGA professional who would offer advice and insight, guests sat inside a Genesis
  G90 car to watch a cinematic recap of their swing statistics projected onto the
  windshield.</p>"

solution: "<p>The ICON team delivered a fleet of solutions:</p><ul><li><p>A cinematic
  recap of guests’ individual TrackMan statistics, projection mapped onto the windshield
  of a Genesis G90 which included custom animations and soundtrack.</p></li><li><p>A
  custom event landing page.</p></li><li><p>A series of tablet applications to drive
  the overall experience—from registering guests to controlling the recap animations.</p></li><li><p>A
  comprehensive software platform, developed in collaboration with TrackMan Golf,
  to utilize the statistics gathered via the TrackMan monitor.</p></li><li><p>A post-event
  email thanking guests and directing them to the GPL landing page to view and/or
  share their personal statistics.</p></li></ul><p>In the two years since its initial
  launch, the Genesis Performance Lab has seen been adapted for deployment at various
  Genesis-sponsored golf events. For example, while the version at the Genesis Invitational
  was designed as a big draw to get people inside of the G90, later iterations have
  forgone the “car theater” entirely to focus more on tracking attendance and gauging
  guests’ interest in the Genesis brand. The Lab provides an excellent way for the
  client team to discover potential customers among tournament participants.</p>"
