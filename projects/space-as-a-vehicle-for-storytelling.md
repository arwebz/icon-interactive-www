title: Space as a Vehicle for Storytelling
client: Peabody Essex Museum / ICON
project_url: ''
introduction: "<p>Inspired by the Peabody Essex Museum’s exhibition “Nature’s Nation,”
  ICON Interactive envisioned how 200 years of rising sea levels might transform their
  local landscape. The Kingston 2219 experience transported guests at ICON’s Kingston
  Street loft to a distant future, spurring thought into how today’s tech is changing
  the ways in which we tell stories and experience the spaces around us.</p><p>At
  the exhibit, ICON employed augmented and virtual reality to transport attendees
  200 years into the future. Their destination: New Boston, a version of the city
  now partially submerged as a result of rising sea levels.</p>"

brief_label: Storytelling Through Tech
brief: "<p>At Kingston 2219, attendees could switch between present and future Boston
  instantaneously. Upon arrival in the present-day loft, each guest received an ID
  card that, when scanned, revealed their unique New Bostonian identity—complete with
  a custom profile image and short biography. If two guests scanned their cards at
  once, they also learned how their future personas interacted with each other.</p><p>Then,
  to jump to the future, all guests had to do was put on a VR headset. The virtual
  loft was filled with stories for viewers to discover as they explored the meticulously
  mapped space. Some of these stories were the realm of fiction: Posters in 2219 derided
  “Wharf Rats,” referencing the experience’s underlying narrative in which New Boston’s
  lower levels were overrun with squatters vying for what little space remained above
  the water.</p><p>However, much like writing a good book, the backbone of this speculative
  fantasy experience was also grounded in extensive research. A weather gauge on the
  future-loft’s windows pinned the daily high at 108 degrees, signifying that it wasn’t
  just the tides that had risen over time. Back in the present, guests’ profiles demonstrated
  how the fictional citizens of New Boston used real methods to adapt to their urban
  seascape. Popular occupations circa 2219 included hydroculture—the growing of plants
  through nutrient-rich solvents instead of soil—and water taxi driving.</p>"

solution: "<p>Beneath its layers of stories and fun “cyberpunk” aesthetic, the Kingston
  2219 event also served to encourage viewers to think about how today’s burgeoning
  technologies have changed the way people experience the spaces around them. When
  guests put on their VR headsets for the first time and saw the loft instantly change
  before their eyes, it created a powerful moment that stuck with them long after
  the event had ended.</p>"

  We can use it to raise questions and tell stories.</em></p>"
