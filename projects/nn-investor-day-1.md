brief_label: Challenge
brief: "<p>The event in 2018 marked the first time that it would be held at their
  new headquarters in Charlotte, NC which opened earlier that year. This state of
  the art facility houses their Innovation Center which was debuted at Investor Day.
  We were called in to create a series of video vignettes for their various end markets,
  as well as an animated piece for their large 12 screen LED wall.</p>"
solution_label: Solution
solution: "<p>With a fairly short timeline of only a few weeks, our design team got
  together and built a series of custom 3D animations and wove it together with the
  companyâ€™s updated branding and existing video footage. We launched this piece on
  the livestream to kick off the Investor Day event and then looped it on the LED
  wall in the Innovation Center. This piece is currently used as an overview video
  for the company and its capabilities when customers visit the Charlotte offices.
  It will also be used on the new NN, Inc. website which we are launching in early
  2020.</p>"
