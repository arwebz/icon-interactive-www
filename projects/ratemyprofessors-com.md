brief_label: Challenge
brief: "<p>Viacom enlisted Hydric to develop an iOS app for Rate My Professors in
  time for the fall semester, and an Android app by the end of the calendar year.
  With over 17 million student comments to search through, the app needed to enable
  easy navigation and a user experience tailored to its captive audience.</p>"
solution_label: Solution
solution: "<p>To achieve this, Hydric first engaged in technical consultancy on the
  API to ensure it was appropriately specced for new mobile applications. At the time
  that Hydric began work on the iOS application, the API was still being built by
  Viacom’s internal team. Managing this dynamic required close collaboration between
  client and agency-side teams in order to achieve the best combination of features
  and user experience within the constraints that the legacy backend systems presented.</p><p>Over
  the course of this project, Hydric consulted directly with more than a dozen Viacom
  stakeholders, whilst balancing their varied needs and expectations. Insights gained
  from previously working with Viacom on projects such as MTV Artists was invaluable
  to this process, with Hydric’s knowledge of Viacom’s technology and working style
  allowing us to anticipate and mitigate potential challenges ahead of time.</p><p></p>"
