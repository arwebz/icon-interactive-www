title: 'Animating for Mobile First: ICON & Education First Pro Cycling'

---
While working with Education First on the website for their pro cycling division, ICON Interactive produced a series of animations designed to introduce the sport of cycling to newcomers in a dynamic but device-friendly way.

To someone who is unfamiliar with cycling, an event like the Tour de France may appear to be a fast-paced free-for-all with every rider jockeying dangerously for a chance at first place. In reality, however, a bicycle race is a tightly coordinated group effort in which each rider plays a strategic role in helping guide his team’s leader to the finish line.

Introducing the team-based nature of professional cycling to newbies and non-cyclists alike is what Education First sought to do through their “How to Explain Cycling to your Friends” page. In keeping with the client’s mission of opening the world through education, ICON landed on the idea of creating a series of animations that would provide a dynamic but informative experience accessible across all devices.
