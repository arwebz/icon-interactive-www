title: Rock and Roll Hall of Fame - DMB's time?

---
The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 2020 Fan Vote [is going on right this instant](https://vote.rockhall.com/).

There are 16 artists being considered including legends such as Pat Benetar, The Doobie Brothers, and Depeche Mode.  But the favorite around ICON's offices is DMB.

Having had the chance to work with the Dave Matthews Band - [who's website we built](https://www.davematthewsband.com/) and maintain daily - we're convinced they're worthy nominees.

Take a moment to vote for your favorites.  The top five artists selected by the public will comprise a “fan ballot” that will be tallied and factored in when determining the final list of 2020’s inductees.

So, a special 'thank you' and 'good luck!' to the DMB organization.  We're pulling for you.
