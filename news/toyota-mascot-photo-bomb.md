title: Toyota Mascot Photo Bomb

---
There’s a new reason to check out the latest Toyota vehicle inside of the Pepsi Center; home to the Colorado Avalanche, the Denver Nuggets, and the Colorado Mammoth.

In partnership with Kroenke Sports & Entertainment and the Denver Hometown Toyota stores, ICON launched our Mascot Photobomb AR Experience as a new interactive experience for guests of the Denver stadium.

Guests are enticed to jump into the vehicle to check out the latest vehicle features, with the opportunity to take a selfie with their friends. As the timer counts down, the mascot pops into the driver’s seat using AR technology and provides an unexpected memorable experience for everyone in the vehicle. Guests are then emailed a gif of themselves and the mascot to share across social media channels.

Those who post to Twitter using the hashtag #toyotamascotphotobomb will also be featured in the digital display at the Pepsi Center.
