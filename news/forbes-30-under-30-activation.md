title: Forbes 30 Under 30 Experience

---
Forbes held its 30 Under 30 event at Detroit's Masonic Temple and ICON helped make it memorable.

Asked by Forbes to create a branded social sharing application, we launched an activation that placed an attendee's likeness [on a Forbe's cover page backdrop](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/forbesunder30summit/?hl=en).

Over three days, thousands of attendees had their photos taken and shared; by far the most popular and social-friendly photo venue.

We thank our friends at Forbes and all of the uplifting attendees for such a successful activation.
